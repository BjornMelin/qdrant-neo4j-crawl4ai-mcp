## üí° Technical Differentiators

### **Vector Intelligence Service**

```python
# Semantic search with advanced embedding pipeline
@mcp.tool()
async def search_vectors(
    query: str, 
    collection: str = "default",
    mode: Literal["semantic", "exact", "hybrid"] = "semantic"
) -> VectorSearchResponse:
    """Advanced semantic search with multiple modes and filtering."""
```

### **Graph Intelligence Service**  

```python
# GraphRAG integration with OpenAI knowledge extraction
@mcp.tool()
async def extract_knowledge_from_text(
    text: str,
    enable_graphrag: bool = True
) -> GraphExtractionResponse:
    """AI-powered knowledge extraction with graph relationship mapping."""
```

### **Web Intelligence Service**

```python
# "Vibe coding" methodology for AI-friendly interactions
@mcp.tool()
async def crawl_web_page(
    url: str,
    extraction_strategy: Literal["llm", "css", "regex"] = "llm"
) -> WebCrawlResponse:
    """Ethical web crawling with multiple extraction strategies."""
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

### **Service Composition Pattern**

The project demonstrates advanced composition patterns using FastMCP 2.0's mounting system:

```python
# Unified service mounting
app.mount("/api/v1/vector", vector_service)
app.mount("/api/v1/graph", graph_service)
app.mount("/api/v1/web", web_service)

# Each service provides specialized MCP tools while maintaining unified access
```

### **Cross-Service Intelligence**

```python
async def unified_intelligence_query(query: str) -> IntelligenceResult:
    """Demonstrates cross-service coordination for complex queries."""
    # 1. Web crawling for fresh content
    web_result = await web_service.crawl_and_extract(query)
    
    # 2. Vector storage and semantic search  
    vector_result = await vector_service.store_and_search(web_result.content)
    
    # 3. Graph knowledge extraction and relationship mapping
    graph_result = await graph_service.extract_knowledge(vector_result.content)
    
    return combine_intelligence(web_result, vector_result, graph_result)
```
