# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the agentic RAG implementation of the qdrant-memgraph-mcp server. These ADRs document key architectural decisions, their rationale, and consequences to maintain institutional knowledge and guide future development.

## Overview

Based on comprehensive research from 5 parallel research agents, these ADRs capture the decision-making process for implementing agentic RAG capabilities on top of our existing FastMCP 2.0 + Qdrant + Memgraph infrastructure.

## Key Research Findings

### Framework Analysis

- **Pydantic-AI**: Optimal for solo developer productivity with FastAPI integration
- **RRF Algorithm**: 2024-2025 industry standard adopted by Azure, OpenSearch, MongoDB
- **Cole Medin's MCP Server**: Production-ready with 6x performance improvement
- **Central Orchestration**: Best balance of control and simplicity for solo developer

### Performance Targets

- **Query Latency**: Sub-200ms for simple queries, <2s for complex multi-agent workflows
- **Throughput**: 1000+ QPS capability with proper resource allocation
- **Relevance Improvement**: 15-30% over single-modal approaches
- **Infrastructure Reuse**: 90% code reuse with existing FastMCP patterns

### Risk Assessment

All decisions are classified as **LOW RISK** with:

- Proven frameworks and integration patterns
- Fallback strategies identified for each component
- Incremental implementation approach
- Existing production infrastructure foundation

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

  1. **ADR-001**: Install Pydantic-AI and implement basic agent structure
  2. **ADR-002**: Implement basic RRF fusion for hybrid search
  3. **ADR-003**: Deploy Cole Medin's Crawl4AI MCP server

### Phase 2: Integration (Weeks 3-4)

  1. **ADR-004**: Implement central orchestration pattern
  2. **ADR-005**: Add GraphRAG hybrid memory system
  3. **ADR-006**: Deploy basic evaluation metrics

### Phase 3: Production (Weeks 5-6)

  1. **ADR-007**: Implement enhanced security features
  2. **ADR-006**: Complete comprehensive monitoring
  3. Integration testing and performance optimization
